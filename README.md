# air-pollution-forecast
We named our model as MCNN-BP owing to its multiple inputs. 
Our MCNN-BP has 2 different inputs, 
a. EPA historical dataset
b. AS simulated dataset

MCNN.py is the main program, all of the datasets are in the dataset folder.

In this study, we tried to forecast the next 3 days PM2.5 for each day.

This is my paper that i published. <br />

Enjoyed yourself!
