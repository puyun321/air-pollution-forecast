# air-pollution-forecast
We named our model as MCNN-BP owing to its multiple inputs. 
Our MCNN-BP has 2 different inputs, 
a. EPA historical dataset
b. AS simulated dataset

MCNN.py is the main program, the model architecture is shown as follow:

In this study, we tried to forecast the next 3 days PM2.5 for each day.

This is my paper that i published. <br />

Enjoyed yourself!
